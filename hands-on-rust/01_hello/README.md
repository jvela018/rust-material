# Hello, World

run a new rust project called testrust

$ cargo new hell-rust

this creates a directory called hello-rust
which in the Rust world is a crate

$cd hello-rust

run the application

$cargo run

This will output Hello,world


ps. Here I used hello-rust but the use of the dash (-) is discouraged. Use underscore instead to avoid referencing issues
