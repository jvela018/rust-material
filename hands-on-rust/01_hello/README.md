# Hello, World

run a new rust project called testrust

```bash
cargo new hello-rust
```

this creates a directory called hello-rust
which in the Rust world is a crate

```bash
cd hello-rust
```

run the application

```bash
cargo run
```
This will output Hello,world

ps. Here I used hello-rust but the use of the dash (-) is discouraged. Use underscore instead to avoid referencing issues
