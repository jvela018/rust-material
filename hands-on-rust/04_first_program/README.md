# Your First Program

This directory is a summary of Chapter 2. For simplicity and focus on each step, we've subdivided the program into 3 programs:

1. Simple program entails the declariation of a string variable, creating conditionals and printing

2. Array program is incremental to the previous program. The additions is that instead of a single entry, we use an array. This allows us to introduce the topic of iterators and improve for loops for this case

3. Vector program, modifies the array program so that you create a dynamic program using loop, and not just checking a single value and exiting the program. It allows to add people to the "tree house" list as the program progresses.
