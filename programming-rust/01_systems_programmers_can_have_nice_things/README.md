# Chapter 1: Systems Programmers Can Have Nice Things

Before we start, it is important to note that the focus on this course is to teach the basics of the Rust language, however this is not a programming class. Let's get started!

## Rust basic information

- Rust is a language for systems programming
- Systems programming is  __Resource Constrained__
    - Every byte counts
    - Every very CPU cycle counts
- The amount of system code involved in supporting a basic app is increasing!


## Where does Rust fit in?

Systems programming is everywhere. Imagine a laptop, you close it, the operating system detects this action and suspends all running programs and turns off the screen, and puts the laptop to sleep. If you open it, you're back to where you left off ...

- There are plenty of topics where Rust can be useful:

    - Operating Systems
    - Device Drivers
    - Filesystems
    - Databases
    - Cryptography
    - Media Processing (e.g., speech recognition, photo editing software)
    - Memory Management (e.g., implementing a garbage collector)
    - Text Rendering (e.g., conversion of text and fonts into pixels)
    - Networking
    - Virtualization and software containers
    - Scientific Simulations
    - Games
    - and more ...
